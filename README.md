# üåê A time zone helper

tz helps you schedule things across time zones. It is an interactive TUI
program that displays time across a few time zones of your choosing.


# Usage

Simply run `tz` with no arguments to show the local time, as well as the
UTC time zone. It gets more interesting when you pass a list of time
zones to the program, as they are displayed below the current time zone.

For now, you need to select the time zones from the [tz_data][tzdata]
list, but I plan to make this friendlier for humans too.

If you would rather not type the list everytime, you could set an alias
for your shell, or use the `TZ_LIST` environment variable with a
semi-colon separated list of [tz data][tzdata] zone names (see
*Configuration* below). Command-line arguments trump the environment
variable.

Check `tz -h` out for other flags.

The program will adjust to light and dark terminals themes.

# Installing

If a build is provided for you architecture, you can directly grab a
release, but no one will be harmed if you build from source, as only
linux/amd64 builds are provided for now.

## Packages

### Brew

Brew has a tz package: `brew install tz`

### Archlinux

If you're an Archlinux user, packages are also available:

  - [tz][tz-arch] follows releases and,
  - [tz-git][tz-arch-git] builds the `main` git branch.

[tz-arch]: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/tz
[tz-arch-git]: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/tz-git


# Configuration

TZ uses standard time zones as described
[here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones).
You can specify what time zones you want displayed by setting the
`TZ_LIST` environment variable. Your local time will always be
displayed. So, if you wanted to display local time + time in
California, and Paris you would set your `TZ_LIST` to
`US/Pacific;Europe/Paris`

## Zone Alias

tz is configured only through `TZ_LIST`, and that limits us to the tz
database names, but you can alias these names using a special value: the
tz name followed by `;` and your alias:

`TZ_LIST="Europe/Paris;EMEA office,US/Central;US office"`

# Building

You need a recent-ish release of go with modules support:

```
git clone https://github.com/oz/tz
cd tz
go build
```


# Testing

```
go test -cover
```
